# DicewarePasswordGen

This password generator uses the EFF list of passwords based on 5 dice rolls. It will randomly generate a number based off of the 5 dice. That number determines what word will be shown.
You can determine the amount of words you want my using the '-n' argument. Otherwise it will use a default value of 4.
